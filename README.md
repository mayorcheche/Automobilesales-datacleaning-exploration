                              AUTOMOBILE BUSINESS SALES DATASET ANALYSIS
INTRODUCTION>>>>

In this report, I will delve into an automobile business dataset, aiming to extract valuable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and overall profitability. Through meticulous data manipulation and analysis, I aim to unveil key metrics and trends to inform strategic decision-making within the company.




PROBLEM QUESTIONS>>>>

1) How can I standardize the date format in the sales data?
2) What is the profit margin for different product lines, and which customers contribute the most and least profit margin?
3) What is the average revenue generated by customers, and which customers generate the highest and lowest revenue?
4) What is the churn rate of customers within a specific time period?
5) How can I evaluate customer behavior based on recency, frequency, and monetary value of purchases?
6) Which customers contribute to 80% of total sales, according to the Pareto principle (80/20 rule)?
7) How can I smooth out fluctuations in sales data using a moving average?
8) How can I evaluate customer behavior based on recency of purchase, frequency of purchase, and monetary value of purchases, and what insights can be derived from this analysis?




ANALYSIS>>>>


1) The date format standardization process involved adding a new column, "OrderDateUpdate," to the "SalesSheet" table, converting the ORDERDATE column to a standardized date format, and subsequently dropping the "OrderDateUpdate" column to ensure data cleanliness.

2) Cleaning the PHONE column required removing specified characters such as ',', '.', '(', ')', '-', '+', and spaces from phone numbers using the SQL UPDATE statement with nested REPLACE functions.

3) Profit margin calculation entailed subtracting the unit price (PRICEEACH) from the total sales (SALES) and dividing the result by total sales. This analysis provided insights into profitability across different segments, highlighting that vintage cars has the highest Profit Margin of 14082.7928991394 making The Sharp Gifts Warehousewhile a high-value customer, truck and buses made the lowest profit margin of 482.039090909091 making La Rochelle Gifts a lower value customer.

4) Average revenue per customer was determined by summing the total sales for each customer and calculating the average. This analysis identified customers with the highest and lowest average revenue, allowing for tailored marketing strategies to retain high-value customers. Euro Shopping Channel generated the highest average revenue of 912294.11 while Boards & Toys Co. generated average revenue of 9129.35.

5) Analyzing the churn rate involved identifying customers who stopped using the product or service within a specific time period, thereby quantifying customer attrition and informing retention strategies. 90 customers out of the 92 customers were churn.

6) Pareto analysis (80/20 rule) allowed the identification of top customers contributing to 80% of total sales. By ranking customers based on sales volume, high-value customers were prioritized for personalized engagement and relationship-building efforts. Euro Shopping Channel and Mini Gifts Distributors Ltd. are the top two customers that contribute 80% to total sales, making them the highest valued customers.

7) To smooth out fluctuations in sales data, a moving average was calculated using the SQL AVG function with a window frame specifying the number of preceding and following rows. This provided a more stable representation of sales trends over time, facilitating better decision-making.

8) Evaluating customer behavior based on recency of purchase, frequency of purchase, and monetary value of purchases through RFM Analysis revealed that Euro Shopping Channel has the most purchase frequency of 259 and total monetary of 912294.11 with the last purchase date of 2005-05-31, indicating them as one of the 2 customers that mostly use and buy the products. On the other hand, Boards & Toys Co. had the lowest purchase frequency with the last purchase date of 2005-02-08.



RECCOMMENDATIONS>>>>

1) Ensure consistent date formatting for accurate analysis and reporting.
2) Monitor profit margins by product line and customer, focusing on enhancing profitability across segments.
3) Devise retention strategies to retain high-value customers and incentivize repeat purchases.
4) Implement initiatives to reduce churn and enhance customer retention.
5) Tailor marketing efforts based on RFM analysis to maximize customer engagement and loyalty.
6) Prioritize high-value customers identified through Pareto analysis for targeted engagement and relationship-building activities.
7) Leverage moving averages to identify underlying sales trends and make data-driven decisions for sustained business growth.
